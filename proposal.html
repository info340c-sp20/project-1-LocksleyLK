      <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>

      <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
      <p>
        In the last three months, Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a threat to
        our lives and lifestyle. As of March 31, 2020, at least 173,000
        Americans have been diagnosed with Coronavirus and over 3,000 have
        tragically perished. This is an important problem to pursue further as
        the number of confirmed cases and deaths climb. Furthermore, it is
        necessary that accurate data is analyzed and published to stop the
        spread of misinformation and fear as well as help scientists and
        government officials make informed decisions.
      </p>
      <h3>Information Technology Problem</h3>
      <p>
        An information technology problem I have in this space is: how can we
        compare how the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus has risen over
        time in different states?
      </p>
      <h3>Past solutions</h3>
      <p>
        Past solutions of this include how
        <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html"
          >The New York Times</a
        >
        has been tracking the growth of Coronavirus and been documenting the
        number of cases over time as well as breaking down confirmed cases by
        state and county. Although this gives a strong nationwide overview of
        confirmed cased over time, an overview of confirmed cases by state over
        time has yet to be accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html"
          >CDC</a
        >
        has also been providing reports on the number of total cases of
        Coronavirus in the United States. This information provides insight in
        the present state of confirmed Coronavirus in each state but does not
        track how these numbers have grown over time.

      <h2>App Description</h2>

      <h3>Users</h3>
      <p>
        The users of my application would be anyone who is curious to see and
        interact with how Coronavirus is progressing in the United States on the
        state level. This can be broken down to include ordinary citizens such
        as concerned students, parents, and small business owners as well as
        professionals such as government officials, teachers, and doctors who
        can draw conclusions from the data to further their understanding and
        research.
      </p>
      <h3>Information Source</h3>
      <p>
        My users will use an interactive plot drawing information from a .CSV
        file compiled by The New York Times. Since the first Coronavirus case
        was confirmed in the United States on January 21, 2020, The New York
        Times has been tracking and recording the number of confirmed cases for
        their reports. The data set contains information on the state, date,
        cumulative number of confirmed cases, and cumulative number of deaths.
        You can view the data on their
        <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">GitHub Page</a>. For
        my application, I will be using the state-level data.
      </p>
      <h3>User Interaction</h3>
      <p>The primary interactions I expect to provide to my users are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Alter the data by state - users will be able to choose which states
          they want to see information about.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alter the data by time - users will be able to select what time frame
          they want to view.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
        My app will solve my problem because it will be able to provide an
        interactive interface to compare different state's confirmed Coronavirus
        cases over time.
      </p>
      <h3>Team Partners</h3>
      <p>I would like to work with Lynzley Kolakowski on this project.</p>
